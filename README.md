# WaveFunctionCollapse
This program generates bitmaps that are locally similar to the input bitmap.

Local similarity means that

* (C1) Each NxN pattern of pixels in the output should occur at least once in the input.
* (Weak C2) Distribution of NxN patterns in the input should be similar to the distribution of NxN patterns over a sufficiently large number of outputs. In other words, probability to meet a particular pattern in the output should be close to the density of such patterns in the input.
